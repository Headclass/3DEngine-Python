# 3DEngine in tkinter
A simple 3D engine which renders vertices in real time using a movable camera. Used to learn and understand the transformation between spaces and the subsequent projection onto screen. The goal was to minimize the use of external libraries and blackbox frameworks and to showcase exactly what happens when a vertex is projected onto the screen. 
# Moving the camera
Use WASD keys to move the camera forwards, backwards, etc. as you normally would in an FPS shooter. 
Use EQ to elevate or lower the camera.
# Rotating the camera
Use IK keys to control the pitch.
Use JL keys to controll the yaw.
Use UO keys to control the roll.
# Dependencies
Uses tkinter, math, and numpy packages.
