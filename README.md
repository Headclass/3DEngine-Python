# 3DEngine in tkinter
A simple 3D engine which renders vertices in real time using a movable camera. Used to learn and understand the transformation between spaces and the subsequent projection onto screen.
# Moving the camera
Use WASD keys to move the camera forwards, backwards, etc. as you normally would in an FPS shooter. 
Use EQ to elevate or lower the camera.
# Rotating the camera
Use IK keys to control the pitch.
Use JL keys to controll the yaw.
Use UO keys to control the roll.
